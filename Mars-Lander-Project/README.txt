Written by Karthik Suresh on 23 Sept 2017, 10:43am

This is a program created as part of the computing course taught in the Cambridge Engineering Degree. It simulates the various trajectories of a Mars Lander around Mars. lander_graphics and lander.h were provided to us for the project. Press ‘h’ for help when the program is running. Run the program through Xcode, or compile the program and run ‘lander’. 

‘Plot_Graph.py’ is a python script written to plot autopilot trajectory data that is output from ‘lander.cpp’. ‘Kh Kp Tests’ is a spreadsheet that collates the various outcomes of the autopilot function as variables Kh and Kp are varied.
